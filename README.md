# Object-Oriented Programming Challenges

This repository contains a collection of exercises and challenges focused on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, implemented in Java. These exercises are designed to help developers understand and practice fundamental OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Project Structure

The exercises are organized into folders based on the type and complexity of the challenges:

- **Introduction List**: Contains introductory exercises focused on basic OOP concepts.
- **POO - Exercises Part 1**: Exercises that dive deeper into object-oriented programming principles, providing practical examples.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

## How to Run the Exercises

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alan-VSouza/OOP-Exercises-in-Java.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder containing the exercise you want to run, for example:

```bash
cd OOP-Exercises-in-Java.git/Introduction\ List
```

3. Compile and run the Java file:



## Exercises Overview

- **Encapsulation**: Some exercises focus on demonstrating how to properly encapsulate data using private fields and public getters/setters.
- **Inheritance**: Examples showcasing the reuse of code through inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: Demonstrates the ability of objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.
- **Abstraction**: Exercises that involve creating abstract classes and interfaces.
